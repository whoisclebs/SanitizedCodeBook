# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PR's for improvements to code snippets, explanations, etc. If there's any doubt or if you think that a word/phrase is used confusingly, **before submitting a PR, open an issue to ask about it.**

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book, as I (and any future publisher) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but I just have to make sure the lawyers are happy by explicitly stating it.

## Search First!

If you have any questions or concerns, please make sure to search the issues (both open and closed!) first, to keep the churn of issues to a minimum. I want to keep my focus on improving the content as much as possible.

## Typos?

If you're going to submit a PR for typo fixes, please be measured in doing so, perhaps by collecting several small changes into a single PR (in separate commits).

## Reading Experience (Chapter/Section links, etc)

This repository is **not yet optimized for your reading experience.** It is optimized for the publishing process.
